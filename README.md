###Approach Taken:
When starting to build Ranter, I really wanted to get to the MVP stage as soon as I could. I wanted to get the basic app set up, with the main CRUD functionality established as soon as I could, so that I could then use the remaining time to add bonus features, use new technologies, and make sure the visual design was well done.
