###Approach Taken:
When starting to build Ranter, I really wanted to get to the MVP stage as soon as I could. I wanted to get the basic app set up, with the main CRUD functionality established as soon as I could, so that I could then use the remaining time to add bonus features, use new technologies, and make sure the visual design was well done.

###Unresolved Problems:
- Search bar, a little buggy
- Liking feature needs to set a limit to the amount of times a user can like a particular post
- Lots of features to add in the backlog
- Need to add more styles/work on design

--

###Next Steps:
- Add more features
